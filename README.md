## Overview
**Intel® RealSense™ SDK 2.0** is a cross-platform library for Intel® RealSense™ depth cameras (D400 & L500 series and the SR300) and the T265 tracking camera.

The SDK allows depth and color streaming, and provides intrinsic and extrinsic calibration information.
The library also offers synthetic streams (pointcloud, depth aligned to color and vise-versa), and a built-in support for [record and playback](./doc/record-and-playback.md) of streaming sessions.

Developer kits containing the necessary hardware to use this library are available for purchase at [store.intelrealsense.com](https://store.intelrealsense.com/products.html).
